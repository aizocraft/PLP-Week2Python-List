# List Operations in Python

This repository contains a Python script demonstrating various list operations. It walks through creating a list, modifying its contents, and performing common tasks like appending, inserting, sorting, and finding elements. The script contains step-by-step comments explaining each operation.

## Features

The script includes the following operations:

1. **Creating a List**  
   Starts with an empty list.

2. **Appending Elements**  
   Adds elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.

3. **Inserting an Element**  
   Inserts the value `15` at the second position.

4. **Extending the List**  
   Merges the list with another list `[50, 60, 70]`.

5. **Removing the Last Element**  
   Uses the `pop()` method to remove the last item.

6. **Sorting the List**  
   Sorts the list in ascending order.

7. **Finding an Element's Index**  
   Locates the index of the value `30` in the sorted list.
